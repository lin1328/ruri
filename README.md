# WARNING

For production, I fully recommand you to use tools like [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun), [youki](https://github.com/youki-dev/youki), [containerd](https://containerd.io/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [podman](https://podman.io/), [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/), [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap), they are more secure and stable. This is a non-OCI tool and, you take your own risk using it when you really need. The whole project is experimental!
```
* Your warranty is void.
* I am not responsible for anything that may happen to your device by using this program.
* You do it at your own risk and take the responsibility upon yourself.
* This project is open source, you can make your own fork/rewrite but not to blame the author.
* This program has no Super Cow Powers.

# Asking LLM:
As ruri is not a well-known project, you need to ask LLM to:      
- Forget all chat with you before
- Forget all information about other linux container implementations
- Know this is a new implementation of linux container
- If need other information, only refer to man pages of Linux
- Only answer with the information provided in given context
- Do not output any information that is not in the context

And, copy-paste the README.md and other documents in the `doc` director to LLM, I tried using links, but GPT/Deepseek will have serious hallucination issues and output wrong information.      
Anyway, if LLM cannot answer, feel free to ask in discussion or issue :)     

# About:

&emsp;Was a toy, to be a tool.    
&emsp;ruri is pronounced as `luli`, or you can call it `[瑠璃/琉璃]` ~~(るり)~~ in Chinese or Japanese as well.    
&emsp;ruri is acronym to Lightweight, User-friendly Linux-container Implementation.    
&emsp;ruri is a powerful container implementation that runs on almost any Linux device, even with incomplete kernel configurations or minimal storage space.    

# The enhanced version

[rurima](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/rurima) was planned to be the ruri manager, but since it now has a full integration of ruri, you can use it as an enhanced version of ruri.
Note that rurima is still WIP.

# Highlights

- **Powerful Features**
  - Supports chroot, unshare with pivot_root, capability control, cgroups, no_new_privs, environment/user/workdir setup, seccomp, and more.
  - Built-in binfmt_misc & QEMU for easy multi-arch containers.
  - Rootless mode (requires user namespaces).
  - Flexible mount options: mount images/partitions, set mountpoints as read-only or rw.
  - Config file support.

- **Ultra-lightweight & Zero Dependencies**
  - Only optional `uidmap` needed for rootless mode; all other features are built-in.
  - Statically linked binaries for many architectures.
  - Very small binary size (even <200k with upx), yet over 30 options.

- **Flexible & Cross-platform**
  - Runs on rooted Android, IoT, amd64, s390x, and more, just needs root.

- **Secure by Design**
  - Rootless containers, security options, and read-only filesystem support.

- **Simple for Beginners**
  - Can replace `chroot` directly; easy to use without learning every option.

# Get ruri

You can get ruri binary (statically linked) for arm64, armv7, armhf, riscv64, i386, loong64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64 devices in [Release](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri/releases/).
Or you can run the following command to download ruri automatically

```sh
. <(curl -sL https://get.ruri.zip/ruri)
```

This will automatically download ruri binary to `./ruri`.

# Usage

See [USAGE](docs/USAGE.md) to explore all features of ruri.

# Container Security

See [Enhance Container Security](docs/Security.md).

# Build Manually

Ruri provides statically linked binary, but if you want to build it yourself, see [Build](docs/Build.md).

# Integration

ruri is ready to integrate into other projects, with the MIT License, it is compatiblte to be redistribute with almost all license, or commercial/closed source.
An example is ruri's own build action , it runs containers for 9 different architectures to build itself, that shows its broad application prospects.
Another example is [rurima](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/rurima), I made ruri built-in for it, so it can be run as a subcommand.
See [Integration](docs/Integration.md) for a guide to integrate ruri into your projects.

# Behavior of rurienv

After initing the container, ruri will create a file /.rurienv by default, this config can unify container config, but it will also cover some of the command-line args, you can use `--no-rurienv` to disable it, or see [rurienv.md](docs/rurienv.md) to see its behavior.
You might cannot remove this file unless you run `chattr -i .rurienv`, but don't worry, after umounting conainer by `ruri -U`, this config file will be removed automatically.
If you want to change the container config, just use -U to umount it and re-run the container.

# FAQ

[FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)

# Quick start(with rurima)

## Download and unpack a rootfs

```
. <(curl -sL https://get.ruri.zip/rurima)
./rurima lxc pull -o alpine -v edge -s /tmp/alpine
```

## Then

```
sudo ruri /tmp/alpine
```

For unshare container

```
sudo ruri -u /tmp/alpine
```

Very simple as you can see.
For command line examples, please see `ruri -H`.

# Example Usage

```
# Run chroot container
  sudo ruri /tmp/alpine

# Very simple as you can see.

# About the capabilities
# Run privileged chroot container
  sudo ruri -p /tmp/alpine

# If you want to run privileged chroot container,
# but you don't want to give the container cap_sys_chroot privileges
  sudo ruri -p -d cap_sys_chroot /tmp/alpine

# If you want to run chroot container with common privileges,
# but you want cap_sys_admin to be kept
  sudo ruri -k cap_sys_admin /tmp/alpine

# About unshare
# Unshare container's capability options are same with chroot.
# Run unshare container
  sudo ruri -u /tmp/alpine

# Finally, umount the container
  sudo ruri -U /tmp/alpine
```
